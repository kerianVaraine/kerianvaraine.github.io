        <p><em>commissioned by Stoma for the Bold Sounds concert, November 2022</em></p>
        <h3>Moments of visceral stasis transcribed and arranged for a networked and spatialised mixed ensemble with distorted electric bass.</h3>

             <p>An experimental distributed score reading application was built to make the piece accessible for performers of a wide ability range, and to allow rhythmic complexity to flourish. This work has become a reflection of an incredibly [dramatic, intense, self-reflective] period of my life, combining [concepts, technologies, efforts] that have [scared, excited, challenged] me.</p>

    <h4>Electric Bass:</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Scordiatura/Tuning (from lowest pitch) - D-A-d-a</li>
    <li>Bass is to be played with a pick, and run through a pedal chain (decribed later) into an amp positioned near the performer. The combination of pedal settings and amp placement should be experimented with so that one note can be held for as long as possible, and for feedback to be controllable.</li>
    <li>The effects to be used are: <b>compression</b> (squeezed to extreme), <b>delay</b> (almost imperceivable, short delay time with high feedback), <b>distortion</b> (tastefully crunchy), with all settings tuned to help the feedback loop).</li>
   
    <li>Notes on extremely low ledger lines (see rehearsal mark 1) indicate to strike the body of the bass with the bottom of a clenched fist.</li>
    <li>Notes stacked (as found at rehearsal mark 2) and held for extreme durations are times where feedback will naturally happen. During this sustained feedback, it may be necessary to bend held notes slightly to help with sustaining, tuning and forming the desired sounds.</li>
    <li>During sustained periods of feedback, the notes indicated are to be held where possible. For example, rehearsal mark 2 starts with an F, followed by a stike, and then F an octave above. These pitches are to be held down to tune the feedback which will happen. The next note that happens could be played with the right hand, hammered on.</li>
</ul>

    <h4>Bowed strings:</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>No vibrato, ord with the attack portion of a note is to be played with harder pressure to help it pop.</li>

</ul>
